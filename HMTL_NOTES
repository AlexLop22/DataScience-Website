HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It's not a programming language but a markup language, which means it's used to structure content on the web. HTML consists of a series of elements that you use to enclose or wrap different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a simple HTML document:

Text Editor:
You can use a simple text editor like Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), or more advanced code editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom to write HTML code.

Basic Structure:
Every HTML document starts with a basic structure. It consists of an opening <html> tag and a closing </html> tag. Inside this, you have two main sections: the <head> and the <body>.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>

Adding Content:
Inside the <body> tag, you can add various types of content using HTML elements. Here are some common ones:

Headings: <h1> to <h6> for headings (h1 being the largest).

html
Copy code
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
Paragraphs: <p> for paragraphs.

html
Copy code
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
Links: <a> for links.

html
Copy code
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
Lists: <ul> for unordered lists (bullets) and <ol> for ordered lists (numbers). Inside these, you use <li> for list items.

html
Copy code
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>First Item</li>
    <li>Second Item</li>
</ol>
Images:
To add images, use the <img> tag. It requires the src attribute with the image file path and the alt attribute for a text description.

html
Copy code
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful image">
Comments:
You can add comments in your HTML code to explain things. They won't be visible on the webpage.

html
Copy code
<!-- This is a comment -->
Whitespace and Indentation:
While not required, proper indentation and spacing make your HTML code more readable.

That's a very basic introduction to HTML. You can create a simple HTML file using a text editor and open it in a web browser to see the results. As you become more comfortable with these basics, you can explore more complex HTML elements, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity to create dynamic web pages. Practice and experimentation are key to mastering HTML.
