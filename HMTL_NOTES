HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It's not a programming language but a markup language, which means it's used to structure content on the web. HTML consists of a series of elements that you use to enclose or wrap different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a simple HTML document:

Text Editor:
You can use a simple text editor like Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), or more advanced code editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom to write HTML code.

Basic Structure:
Every HTML document starts with a basic structure. It consists of an opening <html> tag and a closing </html> tag. Inside this, you have two main sections: the <head> and the <body>.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
